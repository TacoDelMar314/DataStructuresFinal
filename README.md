https://minecraft.wiki/w/Statistics
Use this link to find different categories for statistics.
Here's some input I used, and you can too.
used, obsidian
custom, total_world_time
mined, dirt
used, barrier  (should return an error, since there are no players with this stat)
placed, dirt   (should return an error, there is no category called 'placed')

OH! Also, included in the github here is the folder that contains the stats. MAKE SURE TO UPDATE THE CODE TO READ FROM THAT FOLDER INSTEAD OF THE FOLDER THAT DOESN'T EXIST ON YOUR COMPUTER!
