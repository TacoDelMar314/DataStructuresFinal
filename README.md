Use this link to find different categories for statistics.
Here's some input I used, and you can too.
used, obsidian
custom, total_world_time
mined, dirt
used, barrier  (should return an error, since there are no players with this stat)
placed, dirt   (should return an error, there is no category called 'placed')
